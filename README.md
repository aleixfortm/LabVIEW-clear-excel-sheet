# LabVIEW-clear-excel-sheet
Clearing cells of an Excel sheet does not delete objects (e.g. graphs, images) that are not contained inside a cell. This VI was made to programmatically erase cells and delete objects. It accomplishes so by deleting the edited sheet, and creating a new one with index==1.
