# LabVIEW-clear-excel-sheet
Clearing cells of an Excel sheet using LabVIEW does not delete objects that are not contained inside any cell. This VI was made in order to programmatically erase cells and delete objects. It accomplishes so by deleting the edited sheet, and creating a new one with index==1.
